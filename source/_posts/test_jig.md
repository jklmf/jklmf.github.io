In my long time ago freelance, I still remember how I tested PCBA in my production line (i.e. my room):
```
1. Solder and troubleshoot it.
2. Handholding AVR programer pins to program it.
3. Plug in stuff on each input socket and output socket,
   hold 'secret debug mode' buttons' to enter verifu mode,
   verify it, back to step 1 if it failed.
4. Finish the PCBA and stick the user's name on the box.
```
was painful.

Lately, I am assigned to re-create the test-jig program. Because the original source code is disappeared... The only working reference test-jig is being use in the production line.

I managed to clone the raspberry pi and rebuild one in the office. Then I started to record all the steps from the beginning.
