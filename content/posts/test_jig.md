In my long time ago freelance, the maximum number of PCBA in my production line (my room & myself), was twenty something. I can recall the struggles of troubleshooting...

Lately, I am assigned to re-make the test-jig program for one of our product, because the original source code is disappeared... The only working test-jig is being use in the production line.

I managed to clone the raspberry pi and rebuild one test-jig in the office. Then I started to record all the steps from the beginning.
