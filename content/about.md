Hello, I'm `Falcon`, an embedded hardware & software guy.  I like road or trail long distance running, I helped me to know about discipline. I also passionate about electronic stuff since I was 10.

One day, I found that I can write my very own logic into a chip, and drain current from it to build LED marquee. That chip call 8051.
Then I started to go to libraries and take courses about it. Overnight programming and soldering... I couldn't be happier at that time.  

Many years after, I garduated from post-graduate school. These 15+ years with my whole heart in this field, I felt knowledge is never enough.  

I am glad from all my experiences including school projects, freelances, or different roles in companies, I am still an embedded engineer. I never felt enough on electronics.  
I am looking forward to contribute to my future projects.
